<h1><cyan>$</cyan> Starting a Blog<blink>_</blink></h1>
<hr>
<p>So I decided to make a blog, why? you may ask well I don't really know myself, I just wanted to have something I can devote some of my free time to<br />
I also wanted to just get in the habbit of typing regularly.</p>
<h1>What will be the blog like?</h1>
<p>Well I have not yet decided a specific type of blog, also it's just a personal blog so I'll honestly just add blogs about what's happening in life, What I am working on or just some random cool stuff I found online<br />
I am even thinking of writing reviews of anime I watched but I have a another <a href="http://tanish2002.rf.gd/">website</a> which is related to anime so maybe I'll do that there...again not yet decided.</p>
<h1>How did you make this blog</h1>
<p>Well I considered a lot of option but from the start I wanted to generate the blog using Static site generators but stuff like hexa,jekyll and hugo are too big and have a lot of dependencies which would've been overkill for this small blog<br />
So after some research I settled on a shell script site generator which would use markdown/org as templates, then I started working on making a one but as I'm very <em>good</em> with shell scripts it ended pretty badly but after some searching I found the exact same thing I was looking for- <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">lb</a><br />
lb was written in pure bash and was pretty easy to use but as I said earlier I wanteed to use markdown/org for templates, so I had to tinker a bit with the script and the css and then it worked perfectly<br />
To generate sites all I have to do is <code>./lb m</code> and it asks for the article name and then opens my text editor with the draft file where I can easily write my blog in <strong>Markdown/ORG</strong> after saving the draft I can publish it using <code>./lb p</code> and it auto genrates the article with required css and header tags. For translating markdown/org to html and the other way around I use *<a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>*<br />
The File structure is pretty easy to understand as well</p>
<pre><code>blog
â”œâ”€â”€ rolling.html
â”œâ”€â”€ blogindex.html
â”œâ”€â”€ lb
â”œâ”€â”€ posts
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ .drafts
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ starting-a-blog.md
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ .htaccess
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ this-is-a-test-blog.html
â”œâ”€â”€ rss.xml
â””â”€â”€ sup</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>rolling.html</code> is the blog file where all the blog posts are stored in a rolling release type format, <code>blogindex.html</code> is also a auto generated file where all the blogs are stored in a list type format, in the <code>posts</code> directory <code>.drafts</code> is where all the drafts are stored which are staged to be published and all the other html files are the already published articles, all other things are self explanatory</p>
<h1>Will this blog be updated often?</h1>
<p>Short answer- NO, mostly becuase I'm busy with college and other stuff and this blog was mostly made becuase I wanted to make one :P, though I would try my best to update the blog often. Please don't hate me if I don't kthx.<br />
Anyways I guess I'll end this blog here as this blog was made mostly for testing purpose. Thanks for reading ðŸ˜Š</p>
